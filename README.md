# Diabetes-Prediction 

### Context:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

### Content:
<ul>
 <li> Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 <li> Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 <li> BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 <li> SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 <li> Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 <li> BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 <li> DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
 <li> Age: Age (years)
 <li> Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
</ul>


### Outcome:

A machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not. ðŸ˜ƒ
